# Overview
Exploring issues when levels of 'authority of assertion' are lacking or are uncertain

- Emergence of increasingly fluid, distributed, and fragmented scholarly objects
- Emergence of persistent identification as a (partial) solution
- The growing scholarly graph, e.g. 'PID graph'
- Implications for repositories and the question of 'authority of assertion'
- Scholars' 'PID literacy' as an impediment to satisfactory scholarly objective description (and ergo discovery)
This paper is to outline an emerging problem -- inadequately acknowledged in the literature or in the community.

# Metadata conventions...

- Generating statements of fact about (often) tangible things...
- Even in formal digital libraries, objects (often) static things with predictable descriptive metadata attributes (e.g. digitized objects, etc)
	- Linked Open Data (RDF/URIs)
- "...change is slow" [REF cambrdge book]

# Distribution, fragmentation, fluidity
Disorientation grows for metadata creators but also users in discovery
- Increasing levels of distribution, fragmentation, and fluidity
Emergence of distributed, multi object (often 'non-standard') scholarly objects 
- Multi-object exists elsewhere (e.g. METS package ) but all components under single institutional control where 'authority of assertion' exists
- PIDs increasingly central to linking, disambiguating, discovery

# What are PIDs?
## PID = *persistent identifier*  :smile:
- PIDs come in many flavours, e.g. DOI, ORCID, RAiD, ROR, etc. -- *and beyond!*
`https://doi.org/10.17868/strath.00085975`
`https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8482-3973`
`https://ror.org/05j0ve876`
- Enables long-term identification but also 'actionability' because they are (*generally*) formed as URIs
- PIDs usually underpinned by some form of registry which registers new PIDs and resolves them (and contains *metadata*!) (e.g. DataCite, CrossRef)

---
# Why have PIDs?
## PID = *persistent identification* :wink:
-  Provides unique and persistent reference to an *entity* normally accessible over the Internet
- Maintenance of the scholarly record - citability, verification, reproducibility, replicability
- 'Reference rot' / 'link rot' - e.g [Klein, Van de Sompel et al.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nMRDlR8AAAAJ&hl) [REF]
- Uniquely identify entities on the web; enables discovery these entities -- happy times!
- *Encode PIDs within metadata to link and grow the utility of data*

# Repositories on front line of PID data contributions

`distribution + fragmentation + fluidity`

**Such metadata key to making scholarly works:**

*Interpretable...*
- to contextualize; to provide provenance

*Support reproducibility...*
- to facilitate reproduciblity, verification, replication 

*Discoverable...*
- to enable discovery through a variety of access points, some unconventional

# What is authority of assertion?

Concept of 'authority of assertion' exists but an under-research area; no definitions

- *[authority](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/authority)* = "official permission or the legal right to do something" [Cambridge Dictionary def]

- *[assertion](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/assertion)* = "a statement that you strongly believe is true" [Cambridge Dictionary]

**Ergo, could we propose the following:**

*The extent to which there exists a right to make metadata statements about objects and their relations, such that these statements are reliable, verifiable, and true*

# Authority of assertion and the 'bread crumbs'

# Assertion and 'PID literacy'
Level of authority of assertion exists only as far as scholars' PID literacy

Components of multi-object, non-standard scholarly objects can often be inferred
Lack of authority to assert makes any statement

# Does PID literacy hold the key?
