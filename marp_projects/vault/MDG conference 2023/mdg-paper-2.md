# Repository metadata context

- Repositories remain *very* good at making (scholarly) content discoverable
- [OAI-PMH](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) still a principal machine interface to repository content, despite alternatives (e.g. [ResourceSync](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/toc))
- History - my favourite subject - and the folly of 'simple' Dublin Core...
- Metadata profiles central to improved interoperability and semantics
- Harvesting, aggregation, discovery and... compliance
---
# Profile examples...
Prominent repository metadata applications profiles include:
- OpenAIRE (literature repositories)
- OpenAIRE (data archives)
- OpenAIRE (software)
- UKETD 2017 (EThOS)
- Scholarly Works Applications Profile (SWAP) - deceased, but more on that later!
- Rioxx v2.0, more on this too!

# Title page ad hoc fix

If the title of your presentation is too long and the border intersects with the text underneath, use the following

```html
# Title
<br/>
<!-- empty line here --->
Author's name
University of XYZ
...
```
make sure to leave an empty line below the `<br/>` tag

<!-- _class: tinytext -->
# Tinytext class

- use `<!-- _class: tinytext -->` to make some text tiny
- might be useful for References
